**tmpo** allows you to track time effortlessly with simple commands that live in your terminal. Track time with automatic project detection, organize work into milestones, view stats, and export data; all without leaving your workspace.

## About

### Per-Project Settings

tmpo init

# Or skip prompts and use defaults
tmpo init --accept-defaults
```
